# Class And Object

**A class is a blueprint for creating objects with similar properties and methods. It's a way to define a template that encapsulates the structure and behavior of objects. Classes were introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) and provide a more structured and familiar approach to object-oriented programming.**

## Object Oriented 

**Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that revolves around the concept of "objects." It's a way of designing and organizing code by representing real-world entities and their interactions as software objects. OOP aims to provide a more intuitive and organized approach to structuring code by focusing on data encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.**

```
// es 6 class
class admin{
    name = "Punit";
    profile = "FullStack";
    // this is a privare Variable
    #account = 2023;

    hello()
    {
        return(`welcome ${this.name}`);

    }
    // getter 
    get getAccount()
    {
        return this.#account;
    }
    set setAccount(value)
    {
        return this.#account=value;
    }

}
const tech = new admin();
console.log(tech.name);
console.log(tech.hello());

// undefine
//console.log(tech.account);
// Uncaught SyntaxError: Private field '#account' must be declared in an enclosing class
//console.log(tech.#account);

//setter
//tech.setAccount(2024);
tech.setAccount=2024;
//console.log(tech.getAccount());
console.log(tech.getAccount);
```
